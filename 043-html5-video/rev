1. videojs lynda course:
   1. 'preload' is a double edged sword: http://www.lynda.com/home/Player.aspx?lpk4=84987&playChapter=False
   1. 'autoplay' is easy, ios disable this by default to save bandwidth for mobile devices: http://www.lynda.com/home/Player.aspx?lpk4=84991&playChapter=False
   1. 'loop' not so useful: http://www.lynda.com/home/Player.aspx?lpk4=84991&playChapter=False
   1. 'poster' nice...
   1. 'widthxheight' ...
   1. 'subtitle' ...
   1. to fall back on Flash, there are some code you need to add to your site, and these code will refer to adobe.com, so maybe slow
      http://www.lynda.com/home/Player.aspx?lpk4=84991&playChapter=False
      Does videojs handle this for me?
   1. flash 9+ also support H264: http://www.lynda.com/home/Player.aspx?lpk4=84991&playChapter=False
   1. if you want to customize your mp4 container, try Handbrake
1. detect if html5 video tag, or each codecs are supported or not by opening 
   http://diveintohtml5.info/detect.html in your browser.
   Chrome currently support everything by "will drop H264 soon"
1. for next video
   http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/video/basics/
   has a lot more nice features that I do not have time to check yet
   Will come back!!!

   All the js api here, amazing.

1. Is it really necessary to add 'codec' below:
   as shown at: 
   http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/video/basics/
       <video> 
          <source src="movie.mp4" type='video/mp4; codecs="avc1.42E01E, mp4a.40.2"' />
          <source src="movie.webm" type='video/webm; codecs="vp8, vorbis"' />
          <source src="movie.ogv" type='video/ogg; codecs="theora, vorbis"' />
          Video tag not supported. Download the video <a href="movie.webm">here</a>.
       </video>
       
       Another issue with the .mp4 format is that
       the type attribute needs to be more specific than other formats
       depending on the profile used to encode the video. Although the most
       common is "avc1.42E01E, mp4a.40.2", you should double check this
       profile list to be sure.
    A: Maybe Not, the blog was done in 2010, you know..
       http://videojs.com/docs/setup/ shows me no.

1. For maximum compatibility, here’s what your video workflow will look like:

   Make one version that uses WebM (VP8 + Vorbis).
   Make another version that uses H.264 baseline video and AAC “low complexity” audio in an MP4 container.
   Make another version that uses Theora video and Vorbis audio in an Ogg container.
   Link to all three video files from a single <video> element, and fall back to a Flash-based video player.

   Q: do I really care about "baseline" for H.264?

1. what is mp4?
    http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/video/basics/ (Very good!!!)
   One of the main concerns about using the .mp4 format is that its video codec
   (h.264) is not an open codec and the licenses that a company would have to pay
   for using it are very complex to understand. There's more information about
   this format in this video chapter.

   1. is .mov a mp4 format, or at least is it H264 encoded?
      http://diveintohtml5.info/video.html#webm-cli
      The MPEG 4 container is based on Apple’s older QuickTime container
      (.mov). Movie trailers on Apple’s website still use the older QuickTime
      container, but movies that you rent from iTunes are delivered in an MPEG
      4 container.
   1. mp4 is just a "video container"
      http://diveintohtml5.info/video.html#webm-cli

   1. mp4 can be played by a flash player (version 9+)

1. server types, is this really necessary? NOT SURE
   http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/video/basics/
    The most important thing to remember is to make sure your server is
    serving video files with the correct MIME type in the Content-Type header.
    If not, videos might not work properly, even if they were working on a
    local copy of your site. In an Apache httpd.conf it's enough by adding
    these lines:

        AddType video/ogg .ogv
        AddType video/mp4 .mp4
        AddType video/webm .webm

   you MUST add above to your .htaccess, according to: http://www.lynda.com/home/Player.aspx?lpk4=84987&playChapter=False
   Windows + chrome/IE sometimes can not play happycasts, so need to check this
   1. http://httpd.apache.org/docs/current/howto/htaccess.html
      use http.conf instead of .htaccess is encouraged

   1. if you have 

        <Directory /home/peter/your_video_files/ >
          # This relaxes Apache security settings.
          AllowOverride all
          # MultiViews must be turned off.
          Options -MultiViews
       </Directory>
     
      this will cause problem, remove `AllowOverride all` and `Options -MultiViews`, everything is ok
