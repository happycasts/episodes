1. using videojs
   1. if I have only mp4 as source, (local server to test this)
      1. on Linux+firefox, it fails to fallback on flash, so won't play
      1. on Mac+firefox, it works, and I know on Mac the flash player version is very different

1. now 
   1. happycasts can be played on my thinkpad+linux+firefox, and flash is now in use
   1. But in my Mac+VM+linux, Neither chrome nor firefox can play happycasts, but both can play localserver+videojs+webm/mp4 as source
      1. remove webm, video.local still works as flash in firefox and html5 in chrome, great
   1. happycasts now can only be played on thinkpad+linux+firefox, but not mac+firefox or vm+linux+firefox, be chrome can play happycasts no problem

1. now
   1. jplayer and vjs can only be played if you set proxy
      So it seems my ISP will fuck my video uri
   1. with firefox, even you cross the WALL, neither jp or vjs or railscasts won't play!!!
   1. there is one thing here: youtube can play in both firefox and chrome anytime.
      so maybe I shall set the default play mode to flash

1. Most of the time, happycasts.net won't work, simply becasue a URL like this won't be reached by the broswer
   http://media.happycasts.net/assets/episodes/videos/043-html5-video.mov

   So May I move things back to my homeland ? and add CDN and stuff for my videos
   A: too much trouble, I have Youku doing cdn for me anyway :-)

1. upyun.com CDN

   1. just upload my ocean.mp4 to upyun, very slow to load
   1. but the ctags.mov I uploaded a few days ago, very fast
   1. there is another file named ssh.mp4 which I also uploaded days ago, still can not load in the broswer
   1. check 'about:cache' both ssh.mp4 and ctags.mov are in broswer cache
