1. what to do? Open one file in a big tree
   1. it's not just navigation, it's creating new files and more.

1. why abandon fuf?
   1. no updata for 3 years
1. search mode
  1. default to filename mode?
     1. find by filename is not as nice as find by path, like in my episodes/
  dir, all files are named `wiki`, what differs is the dirname, so yes find by
  path is so sweet here. Find by filename is a bit faster in most cases though.
     1. set ctrlp_by_filename

  1. no matter in file mode or path mode, it's all using fuzzy search. fuzzy
  search is nice. patial match is faster, but not necessary.

  1. Ctrp only has fuzzy match, no patial match, it's great.
     1. I still miss fuzzyfinder's `;`

1. search scope
  1. by default search .git/.hg things to get project root, but what if these
  are not found
     1. search scope will be CWD and down. cool
  1. CtrlP default search scope, it's from the Current Buffer to the .git place.
     1. so if you start vim in `onestep/`, and then you want to open a file in
  `auth-love/`, you can 'cd ../auto-love' then run ctrp now. do a 404 copy.

1. prompt operations
  1. usually you don't use C-j, C-k, unless you use ctrl-z
  1. create file and dir
     1. you can do tab completion, while creating things, cool, lcd is not
needed
  1. explain to people all the bottom info line items means
     1. Ctrl-D to switch between file and path mode
     1. C-f to switch among MRU-FILE-BUF

  1. Ctrl-W, to clear the prompt, it you mistyped things
     1. Use <c-n>, <c-p> to select the next/previous string in the prompt's
  history.

  1. run command while opening file

        videcont:/show
        vicot:25

1. ignore things
  1. how to ignore jpeg files? By defualt ctlp does not.
