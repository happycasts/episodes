Jekyll won't work if you do not add markdown and layout at the same time

if for whatever reason, your code fail to meet jekyll's requirement, you will soon get a Notification:

    page built failure, unable to run jekyll

so do not stupidly refresh your page, over and over again, cause you will never see the new version anyway.
