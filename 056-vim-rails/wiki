# vim indent
Now my problem is in a .c file my indent is four spaces, this is nice, but NOT for my htmls!!!
so have a look at 

    filetype indent on

see how to set tabstops according to filetype
and of course, there is a lot more to fix.

things show work well with <enter> <c-t> <c-d> ...

tabstop=xxx is not enough, you still need `expandtab`
it's also about codingStyle

I've been using vim for more than a decade, but I'm still learning new things everyday.
I use Ctrl-s installed of "Shift+:+w+<enter>"

all the file finding or switching tools, like `find`, `Rfind`, `1R`, `Rfouctionaltext`, `Rcontroller` will not be so useful, since we already have fuzzyfinder working so well.
even `gf hh ii` is no longer sexy
