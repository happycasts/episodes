enough is enough

1. install things
   show all the videos on happycasts.net, tell people now I install with
pathogen

1. indenting is a MUST
   1. requirement
       `o` takes me to the right place next line
       `=` gives me right formatting
       'V>' indent with 2 spaces, `>` actually gives you a tab, so you need to have "set expandtab" and "shiftwidth=2"
       also affect surround.vim

   Now my problem is in a .c file my indent is four spaces, this is nice, but NOT for my htmls!!!
   so have a look at 

       filetype indent on

   see how to set tabstops according to filetype
   and of course, there is a lot more to fix.

   things show work well with <enter> <c-t> <c-d> ...

   tabstop=xxx is not enough, you still need `expandtab`
   it's also about codingStyle


1. rails.vim
   1. now I have fuzzy-finder, do I need thisï¼Ÿ
      A: find, Rcontroller stuff is not sexy
         gf is still cool
      A: you also have RV..., which is nice, but I prefer :vs + fuzzyfinder
way, or even simpler, fuzzyfinder+Ctrl-K
   1. Rextract is nice to have

1. search
   ack


1. snipMate.vim
   set ft
   to check which snippet file you should edit

1. how to surround some code with a div tag, and indent the text at the same time?
   1. surrounding.vim or text-object+macro 
      A: https://github.com/tpope/vim-surround   prefect! V+S+<div class="">
         You can use this in .html or .erb files, cool


   1. you can do really awesome stuff with snipMate+surround.vim in html/erb files

1. ctags
   no need to include rails source in, api.rubyonrails.com is good enough

1. =

1. :h i_Ctr-x-o
   filetype plugin on 
   is needed
   use css.snippets with this
