1. things like Rails Console, provide a nice way to access db, so you can do select and insert and every thing you do with sql in Ruby syntax

   1. I will still want a mysql front-end that's gives my auto-tab-complition, is there one?
   1. oh, you get tab completion in Rails C


1. maybe phpmyadmin or Active record( the dev log) can show me very useful sql lines!!!

1. mysql on ubuntu

    sudo apt-get install phpmyadmin # php-cli and things are installed as deps

and now:

    root@lover:/etc/phpmyadmin# vim config.inc.php

uncomment this line:

    $cfg['Servers'][$i]['AllowNoPassword'] = TRUE;

and add a link:

    peter@lover:/var/www$ ln -s /usr/share/phpmyadmin/

now point firefox at:

1. good habit: All SQL language itself will be upppercase, and table coloumn names will be lowercase.
   by nature, SQL is not case sensitive, but to make it easier to read...
   white spaces and line breaks won't matter, so you can make a much easier to read version of your QUERY, by puting each keyword in a single line

   SELECT * 
   FROM users
   LIMIT 2 , 4

   SLECT id, name
   FROM users

1. need to know how LIMIT works really usesful?

   SELECT DISTINCT state
   FROM customers


   SELECT * 
   FROM  `users` 
   ORDER BY id DESC 
   LIMIT 0 , 30

   SELECT * 
   FROM users
   WHERE id=3

   SELECT * 
   FROM users
   WHERE id<3


   SELECT * 
   FROM users
   WHERE id BETWEEN 20 and 30 

   WHERE name=happypeter---WORNG, need to be WHERE name='happypeter'

   select * from users where state="CA" and city="holywood"
   select * from users where state="CA" or city="holywood"
   select * from users where name LIKE 'h%' # % is * here, and even within '' strings are still not case-sensitive

   INSERT INTO users (name, email) VALUES('peter', 'peter@peter.com')
   delete from users where id=12 

   CREATE TABLE users(
   id int NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,         
   username varchar(30) NOR NULL, # a string no longer than 30 characters
   PRIMARY KEY(id)
   )

   add a column

   ALTER TABLE users ADD samplecolumn varchar(10)
   ALTER TABLE users DROP samplecolumn 
   DROP TABLE users
   RENAME TABLE users TO superusers

    update users set admin=true where id=1;
