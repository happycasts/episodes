1. codeschool.com use mejs, not so nice
1. detect if html5 video tag, or each codecs are supported or not by opening 
   http://diveintohtml5.info/detect.html in your browser.
1. what is mp4?
    http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/video/basics/ (Very good!!!)
   One of the main concerns about using the .mp4 format is that its video codec
   (h.264) is not an open codec and the licenses that a company would have to pay
   for using it are very complex to understand. There's more information about
   this format in this video chapter.

   1. is .mov a mp4 format, or at least is it H264 encoded?
      http://diveintohtml5.info/video.html#webm-cli
      The MPEG 4 container is based on Apple’s older QuickTime container
      (.mov). Movie trailers on Apple’s website still use the older QuickTime
      container, but movies that you rent from iTunes are delivered in an MPEG
      4 container.
   1. mp4 is just a "video container"
      http://diveintohtml5.info/video.html#webm-cli

   1. MAYBE: mp4 can be played by a flash player, becasue "YouTube now uses H.264 to encode high-definition videos, playable through Adobe Flash"
   1. MAYBE:

1. BIG NEWS: firefox does not support H264, that means my .mov videos can not
   play on Linux+firefox, though can be played on chrome+Linux or Mac+firefox
   check the table on: http://diveintohtml5.info/video.html#webm-cli
   Chrome currently support everything by "will drop H264 soon"

1. check if your brower support html5#video or not?
   http://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_video.asp
   A: if not supported, show people the download link, and hide the video player or whatever
   this can be achieved by 

       <video>
          <source src="movie.webm" type='video/webm; codecs="vp8, vorbis"' />
          <source src="movie.mp4" type='video/mp4; codecs="avc1.42E01E, mp4a.40.2"' />
          <source src="movie.ogv" type='video/ogg; codecs="theora, vorbis"' />
          Video tag not supported. Download the video <a href="movie.webm">here</a>.
       <video>

       Note: Because of a bug in the iPad you will need to put .mp4 as the
       first option if you want the video to be loaded in that device. That
       is, until the bug is fixed.

1. why MP4 is widely used as the web video format?
   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML5_video
   A: Apple and Microsoft, controlling 39% of the browser market, support only H.264
   NO single format is supported by all browsers, you have to have more than one `<source>`
   in your video tag

1. For maximum compatibility, here’s what your video workflow will look like:

   Make one version that uses WebM (VP8 + Vorbis).
   Make another version that uses H.264 baseline video and AAC “low complexity” audio in an MP4 container.
   Make another version that uses Theora video and Vorbis audio in an Ogg container.
   Link to all three video files from a single <video> element, and fall back to a Flash-based video player.

1.  I’m going to use “Ogg video” as a shorthand for “Theora video and Vorbis audio in an Ogg container.”
