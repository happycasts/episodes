1. why html5 video?
   1. NO.1 it's the future
   1. ios does not support flash
   1. we will talk about fallback stretegys later
      1. fall back to flash
      1. fall back to a download link
   1. you can customize the thing with CSS, rather than another skinning language
   1. you get much more freedom by controling the thing with JS:
      http://www.w3.org/2010/05/video/mediaevents.html
1. create a html5 index.html
1. add video tag have a source for mp4
   1. It's much nicer to have / for source tag
1. check it in chrome, no controls add 'controls', if you are using videojs or sth, this is not needed
1. open it in firefox, see nothing, now show people the table
   Tell people mp4 is just a container of H264 http://diveintohtml5.info/table-of-contents.html#video (great html5 tutorial)
   and people will see firefox does not support H264
   so add webm as the second source
   1. also check why it's nice add ogv as the third source, why? the table plz
      A: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML5_video, no reason to add ogv now!!

   NOTE: mp4 first for ipad

1. But if you only have mp4 as source, you can use videojs to let it fallback on flash.
   1. But at first it will show a "can not find video with right MIME type" error?
      A: this is fixed by add `data-setup{}` as in videojs embed code
         'AddType video/mp4 .mp4' in httpd.conf made no difference
   1. So now you see it's easy to fallback on flash, so I can still use just one format (.mov) for all browsers
      Yes, use just mp4, and nothing else. Tell this to people.
      Problem here is flash controls looks different form html5 video controls, but with videojs, this is no issue
      Update: NO, firefox sometimes can not Downgrade to flash, I need to add a webm source to make it work.

1. VideoJS is super easy to use
   1. add js&css link in your header: http://videojs.com/#section5
   1. get the embed-code: http://videojs.com/tag-builder/
   1. this is all u need to get going
   1. check if it's html5 or flash is in use by right-click on the screen
