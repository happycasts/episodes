https://gist.github.com/3704968

Opening: in rails-set, I talked about passenger+nginx+rvm, today I want to talk about unicorn+nginx+rbenv, 
    railscasts already has a video for this, so why I do it again:

    1. to remove all the adavanced tips
    1. to remove automizing scripts like capistrano and unicorn_init.sh
    1. just try to tell you what is the things done on earth

mainly I will talk about:

1. install ruby things
   ruby rbenv bundler 
1. install mysql
1. install nginx
1. install unicorn

1. I won't talk about how to create a vps, or how to install sendmail
   No capistrano: just refs:

############ deploy happycasts ##################

1. get happycasts source code
   
       sudo apt-get -y update
       sudo apt-get install git
       git clone ...

1. remove databse.yml
   add it to .gitignore

       mv config/database.yml config/database.example.yml # for later server database.yml
       git push orign master

1. install ruby
   1. rbenv https://github.com/fesplugas/rbenv-installer

       sudo apt-get -y install curl 
       curl -L https://raw.github.com/fesplugas/rbenv-installer/master/bin/rbenv-installer | bash
       vim ~/.bashrc # add rbenv to the top, so it works with capistrano
       . ~/.bashrc
       rbenv bootstrap-ubuntu-12-04 # to install deb packages for ruby, tell people this is automization, but this is clear like water, so nice 
       # cd .rbenv; find .|grep bootstrap-ubuntu-12-04

   1. bootstrap-ubuntu-12-04 ERRORS: it did "apt-get update" first, but still lots of errors, but just for "apt-get update", all the packages done with no error.

   1. so, ruby can be installed.

       rbenv install 1.9.3-p125
       rbenv global 1.9.3-p125
       gem install bundler --no-ri --no-rdoc
       rbenv rehash



1. instal nginx 

    sudo apt-get install python-software-properties; sudo add-apt-repository ppa:nginx/stable
    sudo apt-key adv --recv-keys --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com 00A6F0A3C300EE8C # this only necessary if you failed to addkey by doing last command. 
    # in my case 12.04 ubuntu, this is not needed.
    sudo apt-get update # some error here, but I don't really care, case this only downloading deb names/index, as long as next step is done, it's good.
    sudo apt-get install nginx # if nginx is from ppa.xxx as the output shows it's all fine.

1. add unicorn, remove "therubyracer" to Gemfile, and bundle it.


   need this for GEM: nokogiri
   
      sudo apt-get install libxml2-dev libxslt1-dev
      # show people the error, tell them no worry, just try to type "apt-get install libxml<tab>"
      # things will be soloved, and everything is natural

   for error bundling mysql2 gem, even you do bootstrap-ubuntu-12-04

     sudo apt-get -y install libmysqlclient-dev 

   never forget to do 'rbenv rehash'

1. add unicorn.rb and nginx.conf to happycasts/config (copy and change from onestep/)

   now 

      sudo ln -s /home/peter/happycasts/config/nginx.conf /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/happycasts
      sudo rm /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/default
      service nginx start/restart

   now start unicorn

      unicorn -D -c config/unicorn.rb -E production
      # by the errors here, i know I need to
      mkdir -p tmp/pids
      touch -p tmp/pids/unicorn.pid
      mkdir log/
      touch log/unicorn.log

   now start unicorn done, but the webpage tells us "sorry, something wrong"
   so I go to check unicorn.log I see: "no database.yml"
   so I:
       
       cp database.example.yml databse.yml # change things of course: so I really need to install mysql

    1. mysql
       1. tell people they need to set a password for root user installing mysql, that psword will show up in database.yml file
           
          sudo apt-get -y install mysql-server # mysql-client installed as dep
          rake db:create RAILS_ENV=procution
          rake db:migrate .....

   
    restart unicorn

       ps aux|grep unicorn # tell people the master pid is in tmp/pids/unicorn.pid
       kill -9 `cat tmp/pids/unicorn.pid`  # omit this step first, in order to show people where stderr_path is!!!
       unicorn -D -c config/unicorn.rb -E production

   the command is too long, that's why people have unicorn_init.sh( point to railscasts#335)
   trying to restart unicorn, and I see :"master fail to start,  check stderr log for details"
   I need to show people "stderr_path" in unicorn.rb

   when this is done, the production.log tells me: "xxx not precompiled"

      rake assets:precompile # if nodejs is not installed, and the GEM: therubyracer is removed, "no js runtime" error occour 

    1. javacript runtime Node.js

        sudo add-apt-repository ppa:chris-lea/node.js
        sudo apt-get -y update
        sudo apt-get -y install nodejs

  after "asset:precomiple", only need to restart unicorn, not nginx

   now site works
