Opening: in rails-set, I talked about passenger+nginx+rvm, today I want to talk about unicorn+nginx+rbenv, 
    railscasts already has a video for this, so why I do it again:

    1. to remove all the adavanced tips
    1. to remove automizing scripts like capistrano and unicorn_init.sh
    1. just try to tell you what is the things done on earth

mainly I will talk about:

1. install ruby things
   ruby rbenv bundler 
1. install mysql
1. install nginx
1. install unicorn

1. I won't talk about how to create a vps, or how to install sendmail
   No capistrano: just refs:
      1. http://railscasts.com/episodes/335-deploying-to-a-vps
      1. http://railscasts.com/?tag_id=21

1. javacript runtime Node.js

   now if run 'rails s', you see lacking js runtime error, so install node 
   Edit: come on, we are deploying a server, not setting up local dev env, so no "rails s", try to deploy happycasts/ on vps
   show people when the error happens that way, maybe when I am doing "rake assets:precompile"

    sudo add-apt-repository ppa:chris-lea/node.js
    sudo apt-get -y update
    sudo apt-get -y install nodejs


############ deploy happycasts ##################

1. get happycasts source code
   
       sudo apt-get -y update
       sudo apt-get install git
       git clone ...

1. db things
    1. remove databse.yml
       add it to .gitignore

           mv config/database.yml config/database.example.yml # for later server database.yml
           git push orign master

    1. mysql
       1. tell people they need to set a password for root user installing mysql, that psword will show up in database.yml file
           
           sudo apt-get -y install mysql-server # mysql-client installed as dep
           # there are still headers for mysql2 gem, blah... talk it later

1. install ruby
   1. rbenv https://github.com/fesplugas/rbenv-installer

       sudo apt-get -y install curl 
       curl -L https://raw.github.com/fesplugas/rbenv-installer/master/bin/rbenv-installer | bash
       vim ~/.bashrc # add rbenv to the top, so it works with capistrano
       . ~/.bashrc
       rbenv bootstrap-ubuntu-12-04 # to install deb packages for ruby, tell people this is automization, but this is clear like water, so nice 
       # cd .rbenv; find .|grep bootstrap-ubuntu-12-04

   1. bootstrap-ubuntu-12-04 ERRORS: it did "apt-get update" first, but still lots of errors, but just for "apt-get update", all the packages done with no error.

   1. so, ruby can be installed.

       rbenv install 1.9.3-p125
       rbenv global 1.9.3-p125
       gem install bundler --no-ri --no-rdoc
       rbenv rehash

1. gem install rails, or shall I put it into bunlder
   if I have a global rails, and also a bundle installed rails for a certain project, will rbenv handle this properly?

       rails new blog -d mysql
       sudo apt-get install libmysqlclient-dev # for error bundling mysql2 gem, even you do bootstrap-ubuntu-12-04


# server things ( unicorn + ngnix )
1. instal nginx 

    sudo apt-get install python-software-properties
    sudo add-apt-repository ppa:nginx/stable
    sudo apt-key adv --recv-keys --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com 00A6F0A3C300EE8C # this only necessary if you failed to addkey by doing last command. 
    # in my case 12.04 ubuntu, this is not needed.
    sudo apt-get update # some error here, but I don't really care, case this only downloading deb names/index, as long as next step is done, it's good.
    sudo apt-get install nginx # if nginx is from ppa.xxx as the output shows it's all fine.

1. add unicorn to Gemfile, and bundle it.

   need this for GEM: nokogiri
   
      sudo apt-get install libxml2-dev libxslt1-dev
      # show people the error, tell them no worry, just try to type "apt-get install libxml<tab>"
      # things will be soloved, and everything is natural
  
   also mention mysql2 GEM, header issue here, cause it's same thing

1. add unicorn.rb and nginx.conf to happycasts/config (copy and change from onestep/)

   now 

      sudo ln -s /home/peter/happycasts/config/nginx.conf /etc/nginx/happycasts
      sudo rm /ect/nginx/default
      service nginx start/restart

   now start unicorn

      unicorn -D -c config/unicorn.rb -E production
      # by the errors here, i know I need to
      mkdir -p tmp/pids
      touch -p tmp/pids/unicorn.pid
      mkdir log/
      touch log/unicorn.log

   now start unicorn done, but the webpage tells us "sorry, something wrong"
   so I go to check unicorn.log, everytime is OK, but I production.log, I see:

      database.yml xxxxx
      rake db:create RAILS_ENV=procution
      rake db:migrate .....

   so I need to add database.yml by hand, after this do I need to restart 

   unicorn? Yes
   nginx? No

   trying to restart unicorn, and I see :"master fail to start,  check stderr log for details"
   I need to show people "stderr_path" in unicorn.rb

   when this is done, the production.log tells me: "xxx not precompiled"

      rake assets:precompile # if I did install nodejs, this is when the error occour I suppose

   now restart ngnix, made no difference, so restart unicorn is important(mention unicorn_init.sh)

      kill -9 `cat tmp/pids/unicorn.pid`
      unicorn -D -c config/unicorn.rb -E production

   now site works
