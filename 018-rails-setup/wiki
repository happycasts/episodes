Why passenger in development?
1. don't need to set different port for different site, like using `r s`
2. close to real production evironment

check log: tail -f log/development.log

# rvm
after you install rvm and properly add a line in .bashrc
you can use

    rvm use 1.9.2

to switch from your system ruby, to 1.9.2, however, if you start a new terminal, it will go back, so

   rvm 1.9.2 --defualt

is needed. check http://railscasts.com/episodes/200-rails-3-beta-and-rvm
"if you use rvm, you won't ever use `sudo` for gem installs" --Ryan

    gem list # list out all gems installed for current ruby

so even you have "mysql2" gem installed for your system ruby, you still need to install it again for 1.9.2
