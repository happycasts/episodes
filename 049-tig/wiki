还有看了你的视频，对tig很感兴趣，希望能看到一个关于介绍tig的视频

if you are not have basic understanding of how git works, this video is not for you.

tig is a so called "front-end" to git, so tig is nothing but a prettier git output thing.

1. nice

   tig status
   tig blame

   much nicer than git xxx

1. as a pager

   git log|tig

1. tig -- a_file nice

1. find like vim
   / N n
1. Problem

   tig commands are not full-featured

   like `git diff`, I don't have a `tig diff`
