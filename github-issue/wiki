check howgithubusegithutobuildgithub, issue mentioned

1. commit msg #issue number
   "fix #5"

1. pullRequest and issues

   when you send a pullR, the receiver can find it in both issues and pullRequest, but after it is closed, you can only find it as a closed issue.
   So "a pullResquest is a issue"
