1. apache

    我一直在看您的视频，一直在学rails,前几天自己买了linode
vps,可我发现自己对服务器什么的不是很懂，您有时间能不能讲一讲apache服务器呢，他的模块什么的，和然后和 rails 结合一下。

appserver mode_rails mod_php, what is a mod? why appserver, like unicorn?

1. Mod

   1. list all installed mods

          apachectl -M

   you install a mod than it's part of Apache, like mod_php, but you can also run PHP with CGI
   1. what is a mod?
      http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_modules#Features
      Apache supports a variety of features, many implemented as compiled modules which extend the core functionality. These can range from server-side programming language support to authentication schemes. 

1. RACK and CGI
   http://www.anchor.com.au/hosting/dedicated/Running-Rails-2.3-Using-CGI-with-Rack
   One of the new features of Rails 2.3 is full Rack support, and the removal of all the CGI-specific code that has been with us since the beginning of time. While this is generally a Good Thing, because Rack is a cleaner way to support different ways of deploying and running your Rails app, one unfortunate side-effect of this is that there's no longer a dispatch.cgi in your shiny new Rails apps which allow you to run your app in CGI mode.

   You can run Ruby with apache trough CGI, that what we do before rails2.3
   so there are three ways you can run ruby on apache
   1. install the interpreter in apache itself, namely mod_ruby: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mod_ruby
      1. passenger also call itself mod_rails, and I see in http.conf
         loadModel passenger...
         but is it a real mod_xxx or a app server?
         A: and on it's official site, it is called a "app server", so it is a appserver, that talks to apache as a mod,
            while unicorn talk to nginx throght a socket file.

   1. install ruby on local OS, and run it as CGI: http://shifteleven.com/articles/2008/03/13/dont-forget-about-little-old-cgi
   1. install rack

   CGI create new process for each request, while mod_xxx just use apache processes

1. so first talk about how to setup a basic static site, then virtualhost, then install mod to do sth
   then install mod_rack to run ruby...

1. apache is a http web server, so talk a bit about http: http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616.html 
  https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/HTTP
  MDN has lots of introductory/tutorial like docs for developers.

1. virtualhost

The term Virtual Host refers to the practice of running more than one web site (such as company1.example.com and company2.example.com) on a single machine. Virtual hosts can be "IP-based", meaning that you have a different IP address for every web site, or "name-based", meaning that you have multiple names running on each IP address. The fact that they are running on the same physical server is not apparent to the end user.

  1. http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/vhosts/name-based.html


The Apache HTTP Server, commonly referred to as Apache (/əˈpætʃiː/ ə-pa-chee), is a web server software notable for playing a key role in the initial growth of the World Wide Web.[3]
