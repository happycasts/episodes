In general, httpd should not be invoked directly, but rather should be invoked via apachectl on Unix-based systems 
http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/programs/httpd.html


Apache is the most commonly used Web Server on Linux systems. Web Servers are used to serve Web Pages requested by client computers. Clients typically request and view Web Pages using Web Browser applications such as Firefox, Opera, or Mozilla.

1. virtualhost

The term Virtual Host refers to the practice of running more than one web site (such as company1.example.com and company2.example.com) on a single machine. Virtual hosts can be "IP-based", meaning that you have a different IP address for every web site, or "name-based", meaning that you have multiple names running on each IP address. The fact that they are running on the same physical server is not apparent to the end user.

The Apache HTTP Server, commonly referred to as Apache (/əˈpætʃiː/ ə-pa-chee), is a web server software notable for playing a key role in the initial growth of the World Wide Web.[3]
