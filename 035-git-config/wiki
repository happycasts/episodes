some cool git-config tricks for myself, will be a talkshow

1. where it is?

    man git-config # check FILES and ENV
    # smaller scope, higher priority
   
   It's just unix covention, show `ls -a`

1. set username&email for commits

   1. use commandline

       git commit --author="Peter Wang <happypeter@dog.org>"  -a -m"hello" # no way to set --committer
       # for really selfish people
   
   1. write into your ~/.gitconfig # this is what --global will do, and 99% time your want to do

      works for author&commiter, in all the user's projects
      .git/config 

   1. the ENV, I think it's git server sys admins to write script, so I never touched it before.

1. a quick walkthrough of my .gitconfig

1. query the settings, even you can have `cat ~/.gitconfig`, you still want

       git config user.email
       git config alias.throw
       git config push.default
       git config --list

1. a lot other cool things, check man git-config

   1. check the meaning of a specific option

      man git-config # then `/push.default`
