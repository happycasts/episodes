1. Before I use capistrano, I use scripts
   https://gist.github.com/3634487
   1. but a nice automation tool has its place:
      1. A nice tool is nice in that it encourages a very best common practices, nice workflows, 
         that's why it worth while to learn a tool, rather than build it up from scrach.
      1. And since we are following same workflows, it's now easier to communation within or outside our team.
1. certain things will be handled by cap by default
   1. capistrano's flow demystified: check pdf here: https://github.com/capistrano/capistrano/wiki/2.x-Default-Deployment-Behaviour
1. create a new project named blog, copy nginx.conf and unicorn.rb form ep38
   1. I will use the env setup in ep38, that is I don't care rvm+ruby+nginx+unicorn+mysql installation
1. do things, have mistakes, check what's need to be modified in your deploy.rb
   (sometimes, we just don't know what to do, so steal! check ruby-china/deploy.rb)
   1. if we don't know what to do, google it, if we don't know how to do, learn from other people's script
   1. no bundle install (google it)
      1. http://gembundler.com/deploying.html (tell you what to do)
      1. http://blog.josephholsten.com/2010/09/deploying-with-bundler-and-capistrano/ (tell you what's happening under the hood)
   1. no db:create
      1. have to run 'rake db:create RAILS_ENV=production' manually
         all the tasks "cap deploy" "cap deploy:migrate" "cap deploy:setup" won't do it for me!!!
   1. "rake assets:precompile" won't be done either
      I know I need to add some options in deploy.rb

1. Code is the final documetation!!!
   1. if you don't know a default value of certain variable
      cd `bundle show cap`; xxx current_path

1. about unicorn restart
   1. ruby-china is simple
   1. rails-casts is more flexiable with sys admin concern

1. we won't cover how to orgnize all your stuff better, check
   With your project getting large, you need to bring more tricks in,when you deploy.rb gets really complex, it's better to rc#cap recipes.
   337 cap recipes: not for beginners, but of great practical use after you pass the beginning
