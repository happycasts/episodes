# install rbenv and ruby
https://github.com/sstephenson/rbenv#section_2

NOTE: on ubuntu don't use `.bash_profile`, just use `.bashrc`
go to Zh site to download 1.9.3, En site seems to be blocked
http://www.ruby-lang.org/zh_cn/downloads/

to compile, have to 

     sudo apt-get install autoconf bison
     # automake is installed as dep

after make&&make install, do

   rbenv rehash
   rbenv version #current verion is still `system`
   rbenv global 1.9.3-p0


now clone octopress

   cd octopress
   rm  .rbenv-version # cause it requires higher verion than p0
   gem install bundler
   # error: you have not write permission to /home/peter/.rvm/xxx
   # fuck, rvm is still here

so stop using rbenv for this, too much trouble, go back and use rvm instead, now back to user: peter


    rake preview # Great
