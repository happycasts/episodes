# install rbenv and ruby
https://github.com/sstephenson/rbenv#section_2

NOTE: on ubuntu don't use `.bash_profile`, just use `.bashrc`
go to Zh site to download 1.9.3, En site seems to be blocked
http://www.ruby-lang.org/zh_cn/downloads/

to compile, have to 

     sudo apt-get install autoconf bison
     # automake is installed as dep

after make&&make install, do

   rbenv rehash
   rbenv version #current verion is still `system`
   rbenv global 1.9.3-p0


now clone octopress

   cd octopress
   rm  .rbenv-version # cause it requires higher verion than p0
   gem install bundler
   # error: you have not write permission to /home/peter/.rvm/xxx
   # fuck, rvm is still here

so stop using rbenv for this, too much trouble, go back and use rvm instead, now back to user: peter

# google analytics

super easy to add

# disqus

check _layout/page.html, I see

    {% if site.disqus_short_name and page.comments == true %}

so I need to set two options to get disqus work, one is in _config.yml, the other only needed for pages,
so by default for posts, you can leave this option empty.

# diable the `tweet` link

trace where it is from: _layout/post.html -> _include/post/sharing.html -> _config.yml

    twitter_tweet_button: false

this will work after you restart 'rake preview'
can also use `sharing: false` in each post page to hide the sharing div, but this is not the desired result.

# test

    rake preview # Great

# add about.html

     rake new_page['about.markdown'] # then remove `sharing` and `comment` option in this page

# add field in navbar

_includes/custom/navigation.html:

     <li><a href="{{ root_url }}/about.html">About</a></li>
