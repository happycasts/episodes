1. why octopress
   1. jekyll lacks features
   http://blog.xdite.net/posts/2011/10/07/what-is-octopress/

1. setup
   basically, follow whatever in http://octopress.org/docs/

   1. install git, rvm and ruby
      http://octopress.org/docs/setup/

          sudo apt-get update; sudo apt-get install git
          rvm install the_version_in_octopress_rvmrc
          cd octopress # the version shall be that version now
          ruby -v

      now clone octopress

         cd octopress
         gem install bundler
         bundle install


    1. install theme

         rake install # why? for theme customization and updating octopress, talk later

   1. deploy to github

      http://octopress.org/docs/deploying/
      http://octopress.org/docs/deploying/github/
 
      git add . # check .gitignore
      git push orign source # master is used for _deploy

1. common tasks to help people understand the structure better
   
   1. google analytics

   1. disqus

      check _layout/page.html, I see

          {% if site.disqus_short_name and page.comments == true %}

      so I need to set two options to get disqus work, one is in _config.yml, the other only needed for pages,
      so by default for posts, you can leave this option empty.

   1. diable the `tweet` link
      trace where it is from: _layout/post.html -> _include/post/sharing.html -> _config.yml
       
          twitter_tweet_button: false

      this will work after you restart 'rake preview'
      can also use `sharing: false` in each post page to hide the sharing div, but this is not the desired result.
   1. add about.html

        rake new_page['about.markdown'] # then remove `sharing` and `comment` option in this page
        # add a img here, show people how easy it is.

   1. add field in navbar

      _includes/custom/navigation.html:

         <li><a href="{{ root_url }}/about.html">About</a></li>

1. workflow, to explain the dir structure
   1. do local work

    rake preview # Great

     need to to `git add .; git commit xxx; git push orign source` early, in order to see changes with `git diff & git st`
     Just do sth minium add then 'push orign source', then delete octopress, and clone happycasts.github.com, and continue work on its `source` branch


   1. rake

      rake -T # to see all the tasks

   1. version control your source; update octopress 

      now I know why `rake install` in the first place
      but even there won't be conflicts for source/ and sass/, but still Rakefile and _config.yml is changed as well!!!

       git checkout source
       git pull octopress master
