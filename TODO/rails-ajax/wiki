1. ajax has Xml in it's name, but xml is not popular now, we use json and js
here
   1. dataType: http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/
      1. you can also get js from the server
      1. so yes $.ajax() is much more powerful than rails ajax convention

1. $.ajax() another powerful way to do ajax

1. steps to change a normal thing to ajax thing
   1. add 'remote: true', can you see
      tail -f log/devlopment.log
        Started POST "/comments" for 127.0.0.1 at 2013-04-02 08:27:07 +0800
        Processing by CommentsController#create as JS
   1. so add response_to format.js in controller
   1. add the right xxx.js.erb in right place
   1. u can use instance variables, you can render paritial even, so that's
powerful
   1. but when there is a error, you often won't get noticed.

1. debug: when there is a error, but no error msg? under what situation?
   1. if you have ruby error in controller code, you see the error in the
broswer, and of course it's 500
   1. but if you have error in the .js.erb
      1. if you have error in ruby code you have 500 shown by devtools
         but the detailed error msg,  only shown devtools
      1. But if you have error in the js returned by server, no msg
         you get the full response js code in devtools, you can copy it to
console to check errors.
   1. if you have error in the pure client-side script, devtool will report
1. routing
1. the variable scope, how to pass instance variable to .js.erb file
1. why `j`
1. jquery-ujs for `date-remote: true`
