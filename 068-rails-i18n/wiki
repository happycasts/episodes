* #encoding: utf-8
  the easily i18n police is no i18n at all :-)
  if you want to have Chinese in xxx.rb file, you have to use this to tell
ruby, otherwise error. but not needed for .erb or haml file, since it is set
in application.rb.

* set_locale
  * `t` means translate
    use names, set en.yml
  * change to chinese
  use cookie
  
  * use params,http://guides.rubyonrails.org/i18n.html

      before_filter :set_locale
      def set_locale
        I18n.locale = params[:locale] || I18n.default_locale
      end

 

* I18n.l
  u can now use <%= l Time.now %>, without rails-i18n

* .zh-CN.html, sometimes you need to change template as well

* for datetime,form label, every static string in the Rails framework 
  show people a form with datatime select input
  show them they can not switch to Chinese, since the translation is missing
  show them they can do them by hand
  show them they can also install rails-i18n gem, once for all
  and if you don't like things in rails-i18n, you can always overwrite in your
only locale/xxx.yml file

* flash msg, http://guides.rubyonrails.org/i18n.html
  flash[:notice] = t(:hello_flash)
  
* more stuff
  https://github.com/svenfuchs/globalize3 for saving translation in db
  http://railscasts.com/episodes/138-i18n-revised
  check copycopter, backend stuff
  * generally you don't want programmer's to maintain the locale files, so you
need a backend.
