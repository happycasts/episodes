Google I/O 2011: Chrome Dev Tools Reloaded

1. styling
    1. It's a web app, that means its in Js&CSS&html, no C++ stuff
    1. Dev tools are a set of integrated broswer tools, so part of the brower, no add-ons needed
    1. you can make changes right here in the browser
    1. double click to add css styling, tab works, also tab to autocomplete.
     
           back<tab> # give you background
           background: papa<tab> # bring you the full color name

    1. click the block after `color:`, you can try all kinds of colors, and see the effect right there
    1. so do can do a lot of changes to your css, then goto "resources" right click on  the stylesheet and "save as"

1. networking
   https://developers.google.com/chrome-developer-tools/docs/network
   Both 'networking' and 'timeline' are part of "Delivering to the client"

   1. for each "request", there is a entry in network pannel
   1. so this is "loadtime"
   1. XHR: xml+http+resources: sth has to do with ajax

1. timeline
   https://developers.google.com/chrome-developer-tools/docs/timeline

   1. "when we intersted in what's happening after the page load, we can look at the timeline"
   1. "The Timeline panel gives you a complete overview of where time is spent when loading and using your web app or page. All events, from loading resources to parsing JavaScript, calculating styles, and repainting are plotted on a timeline."
   1. time spend to render the page after timeline
   1. javascript time: loading -> scripting -> rendering -> painting

1. js debugging

   1. open your script, ctrl-g( on ubuntu) to go to certain line
   1. set a breakpoint by just clicking on the line number
   1. you can only console now, to type in a variable name to check its value
   1. Ctrl-shift-o(on ubuntu) to open member

1. Sources or Resourses

    1. you have the '{}'(pretty print) icon to handle uglified js&css code now!!

       tested with happycasts.com, only works for js, not css

   1. right click -> local modifications, very helpful
      don't know how can make this work for uglified css and js

1. ? to show helps
