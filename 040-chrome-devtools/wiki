1. Tips

   1. "Cmd-F" to search, check Settings -> shortcut for more
      1. if you want global search, you need to do it in "Resource" pane, if you want to pretty print js files, you have to be in "sources" pane
         this is not good

   1. Recouses -> Cookie, you can delete something like `token`

   1. chrome devtool came with its own $, it's not jquery, and used in cased like $$ $0

! Now I see

   1. the "li.current" attrributed is added on server, not by local js, that's why I could not grep "current" in resources
