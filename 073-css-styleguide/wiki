* if you are not familiar with sass, this video is not for you
* show people the whole idea by evolving a simple code base.

* some things are global, some are local
  class names in global sort will have low specifity, use short names
  class names in local sort will use very long precise names to avoid
conflcting with global names, and to be Ack friendly, you don't want to two
diffent styling under the same class name.

  * global
    * helpers
    * mixin
    * variables
    * shared/    -- reusuable styles, mixed with other styles to define a
                    element.
      * if a file in shared/ dir is too small, it can be placed as a mixin in
        globals/mixin.css

  * local
    * components/ -- reusuable parts, must be used more than once
    * sections/   -- business logic, controller based
    *

* differences between require and import
  * sass and sporcket who run first?
    - for globales/variables or mixins, you HAVE TO use @import, if you use
      =require, sass compiler simply can not find these variables
      because sass compilation is done before sprockets compilation


* a real example: how you define the markdown style
  * have shared/markdown.scss

     @include globals/...

     .markdown-format {
       basic markdown rules here
     }

  * have sections/blog.scss

      .blog-markdown-body {
        font-size: 20px;
        color: yellow;
      }

  * in the blog.html

      <div class="blog-markdown-body markdown-format">
