I need to focus on "get the job done", like in this video, I sure need to setup pubkey and private key for people, but I won't explain, at leat not too much.

SSH不仅可以用于远程主机登录，还可以直接在远程主机上执行操作
ssh server 'touch abcd'

# install

sudo apt-get install openssh # this is mostly pre-installed
sudo apt-get install openssh-server # need to do this, if you want your machine to be a server
http://www.openssh.com/


# login without password

first do what ssh-copy-id can do, then tell people that maybe available, maybe not.

# scp
