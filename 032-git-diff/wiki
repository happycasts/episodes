1. what's the smallest unit of `git add`
   1. `git add -i`, a patch? what is a patch?
      1. I will call it a "change unit"
      1. when you change sth, diff will get leading and trails 3 lines as context
      1. so it takes 7 lines to separated a *change hunk* from another
      1. it's the unit you can do `git add -i`
      1. it's the unit to decide if it is a *conflict* or two, when you merge things
