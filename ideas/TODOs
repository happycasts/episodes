1. apache

     superbatironmans5 说 大约 16 小时前
     @happypeter 我一直在看您的视频，一直在学rails,前几天自己买了linode vps,可我发现自己对服务器什么的不是很懂，您有时间能不能讲一讲apache服务器呢，他的模块什么的，和然后和rails结合一下呢。。。我知道nginx服务器也很火，可是我觉得还是了解下最经典，网络上用的最多的apache比较好。

感谢分享。有时间能否分享一下您是如何用VIM做rails开发的。尤其是怎么样重构。比如抽取函数，partial。还有debug。谢谢

change Email for all commits

    git filter-branch --env-filter "export GIT_AUTHOR_EMAIL=you@you.com" HEAD

`git bisect` is simple and helpful
`.gitattribes` make img diff for you, very useful info shown in the diff result

# what is a "change" in diff/git world

  show people the `7lines` rule, when talking about git merging
  what's a conflict

# vim indent
Now my problem is in a .c file my indent is four spaces, this is nice, but NOT for my htmls!!!
so have a look at 

    filetype indent on

see how to set tabstops according to filetype
and of course, there is a lot more to fix.

things show work well with <enter> <c-t> <c-d> ...

tabstop=xxx is not enough, you still need `expandtab`
it's also about codingStyle

 关于开源文档的问题,你的那个视频我已经看过了
 我说个具体的问题吧,我正在翻译神器emacs的官方手册
 http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/emacs.html
 我在上述地址下载了手册的源码,可是完全无法编译
 我也看过你视频中的关于texlive等工具的介绍
 也自己上网搜索了一些关于Texinfo等工具(格式)的介绍
 可是还是无法成功编译,当然写成mardown格式也可以
 但我还是希望可以和原版原汁原味的感觉
 如果有空的话,请指导一下我这个小菜鸟吧:)

vim is a programming language for text editing, it's not easy, but if you can learn ruby you can learn vim!
I've been using vim for more than a decade, but I'm still learning new things everyday.
I use Ctrl-s installed of "Shift+:+w+<enter>"

all the file finding or switching tools, like `find`, `Rfind`, `1R`, `Rfouctionaltext`, `Rcontroller` will not be so useful, since we already have fuzzyfinder working so well.
even `gf hh ii` is no longer sexy

# git workflow
now I think I need to modify my gitworkflow a bit, now I do all the tiny commits, which is both good and bad.
It is good in that, by having all the little steps, I am always allowed to try stupid code. Bad is that I end up having too much moise in my history, which makes even myself painful, in later dev.

So I think to fix this:

    1. think about what I do this time
    2. submit a github issue for this
    3. git br -d feather-x
    4. do my micro-commits on this branch
    5. git rebase -i master
    6. have "#10" to track with the issue

1. screen and tumx
1. Git object model

   `Git communit Book` has really nice talk on this.( + "RAW GIT" in last part of the book, will be nicer)
   http://blip.tv/scott-chacon/c5-git-browsing-4113562

    and also "disributed workflow" in this book also makes a nice episode

1. git teasing talk
   git-scm.org/about

   Linus git talk: 0:24:02: centralized system will result in huge commits and this is horriable. Because during all the two weeking while you are making the patch, other people can not check your changes.

1. Tech Talk: Linus Torvalds on git

   1. 0:15:25 everytime you disconnect your laptop and start working on it, you are on your own branch
   1. we like branches so much, some people have 5 or 10 branches ( Peter: Yes, if you know how to merge)

1. git resources:

   gitreal.codeschool.com


YOUTUBE: Git: Tips and Tricks for Ruby Teams
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2ZL14WWEJI

1. gitconfig

   l = log --online --decorate --graph 
   fixup =  commit --amend -C HEAD
   untacked-files = ls-files -o --exclude-standard
   ignored-files = ls-files --others -i --exclude-standard
   modified-files = ls-files -m


1. git add -p
   has `s` for split a hunk in to small ones
   has `e` for editing a patch

   git checkout -p is the going-back of this

1. git remove trailing spaces

       git config --global apply.whitespace fix

1, set `git pull --rebase` as defualt

1. only push the current branch ( `git push`) defualt behavior is to push ALLLLL branches

      git push --global push.default tracking

1. New feature!!!

       git check -b new-feature
       # work on it, commit it anyway, even there is two ideas go in one
       # commit, having a lot of WIP commits

then istead of doing `rebase -i` you do `git reset master-head`+`git add -p`, cause this way you only need to do the pick and choose seriously at the end
you don't have to commit the patches for two ideas separatly as you do before while using `git reabse -i`, so a much better/natural/simple solution
       

## a really nice workflow
http://ruby-china.org/topics/4768
http://blog.hashrocket.com/posts/feature-development-with-git-branching

http://ruby-china.org/knwang

    需要在branch上很久的时候多半是要完成一整块的feature set才能整合在master里面， 比如，凡是涉及到付费的时候就要把很多情形考虑到做完才能一起deploy。可以每做完一小块测试通过后就git checkout master; git pull --rebase origin master; git checkout my_branch; git rebase master

    这样先把远程master别人的代码拿下来，再rebase到自己的branch上面。再跑测试。 通过了之后git push origin my_branch, 这样就不用担心比如电脑掉到水坑里，或者需要别人接着做这个大feature set. 再继续做下一小块。原因还是每次集成少量代码，有问题早解决。而remote branch伤得的commit message也可以作为一种和同事的交流工具，让别人知道你做到哪里。

    等到feature set做完, 还是一样git checkout master; git pull --rebase origin master; git checkout my_branch, git rebase master; run test; git checkout master; git merge my_branch (fast forward); git push origin master; deploy

    总结下，

    1) 所有developer的本地master都紧跟remote master，而且都是working code, 随时可以deploy
    2) 本地上推前先抓remote master， 整合测试通过后从local master push remote master, no conflict.
    3) push/deploy often, push/deploy early
    4) remote branches做备份和交流

    要是出现了几个long living branch又都不能很快deploy的时候就比较复杂，可以考虑再开一个非master的integration branch. 但这种情况一旦出现更多的是整个项目的筹划出了问题。


on `my_feature` branch

    git reset --soft HEAD^^^
