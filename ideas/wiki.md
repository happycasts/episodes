1. there are many good videos out there, and there will be more, so what's the
point to make your own?
   A: happycasts won't be popular without some sort of service. or sth.
      Need to figure out the missing piece!

however great a graph helps with explaining things, I won't use it!
casue "limit the number the details" is key!

# add time point

Sean Soong suggested he wanted to get the point he want quickly
I want a minified version of Asciicasts, not show noting
so how are sth like this

  1. give a brief intro 00:00
     ...
  2. talk about feature 1 05:00
     ...
  3. talk about seconde feature 07:22
     ...


# Do not try to repeat some tech terms to stress on sth, try to make it
cleared expressed.
DONT:
  - "this is important, this is important"
  - "this is very important"
  - "Note here we need to get a filename, not pathname, not pathname"
  - no need to repeat "not pathname"
  - "later, after some time"
  - this is just brain damaged
  - things like "prompt" "compile" should be in Chinese
 
try to pronunce each word clearly, try to use more formal lanaugage,
# railscasts also tech basics A LOT
check intro to sass asset-pipeline and so on, good inspiration 
# real code first

if I want to show some detail to people, I do not go to repeat the book
concept over and over again, instead I will show people working code(try to
make the code example simple, but it should not be just concept code, it
should be code that get some real work done, so that it will make more sense
to people)

### screencasts spec

have a  ubuntu gnome-terminal profile named "happycasts", use "black on white", "font: monospace 17", set this profile as defualt.

then have a command "gohappycasts"

    gnome-terminal --full-screen --hide-menubar

fullscreen the vm, that will make my later work in screenflow to make the video 1024x768, a lot easier.

Turn keycastr background color to "Teal"(looks like the blackboard), it is more comfortable to look, and clearer.

make it 10 mins, try to show people as much as I can, lead them step by step towards getting the job done.
10 mins means the audience's time is cherished, and 10mins means not too much works for myself, so limit does bring goodies.

termial -> edit profile -> disable scrollbar


# happycasts
a gdb happycast will make gdb so friendly and lovely to newbies
    
    we only show you the most useful tips
    we do not just tell, we show you how to use it
    we explain a bit about whatever confused ourselves while we were tyring to

so happycasts is some sugure.
it is sweet, it is lovely, it does not scare you away but showing you tons of
advanced fetures of softwareX. Instead, it just gives you the most useful and
tips you will be most interested about softwareX. After finishing one cast,
you will say, he this software will be useful, and it is not difficult to

# microphone
the side with buttons are the back of it!!!

# mouse on the screen
if the mouse positions are differnet on two adjacent clips, it is ugly.
the fix is simple, click on the vm screen once, then move the mouse out of vm
screen. the terminal will just work, and firefox will just work, when you move
the mouse in, you don't need to click again.
