1. When you need to compile by your own hands?

1. do 

   vim hello.c
   gcc hello.c -o hello
   ldd hello 
   locate stdio.h

   http://www.gnu.org/software/make/
   show config-file, binary/exe file is not all of the stroy of `make install`

1. when you need to install by hand?
   install tig

     1. make will bring a 'no ncurse.h' error
     1. apt-get can install it, so it's binary in that deb package
     1. Gem install xxx also has such .h missing problem, so we know 'Gem install' will download source and do compiling locally

Everything people need to know is a binary is not running along it has dependencies.

   1. why configue&make&make install

1. why you should use package manager?
