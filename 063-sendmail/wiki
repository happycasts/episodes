1. on ubuntu1204-server, apt-get sendmail, it just works
   sendmail to my emailbox and then I go to my gmail and check the sender:
  peter@li411-244.members.linode.com
   need to change it into support@happyec.org, but HOW?

   BTW, the mail is not put in the spam, cause li411-244.members.linode.com
does match the IP of the sender.

1. change sender to happyec.org

     echo "MASQUERADE_AS(`happypeter.org')dnl`)" >sendmail.mc
     # do git init /etc
     root@lover:/etc/mail# m4 sendmail.mc >sendmail.cf
     root@lover:/etc/mail# /etc/init.d/sendmail restart

   now the sender is "peter@happyec.org"
