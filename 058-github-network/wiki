every little feature came to me as a surprise. Never think sth could be so
useful, I mean.

It is a TODO,

NW can also have you to check if you have undeleted branch name on server

Once you fork a repo, your name shows up in "Members" under network

When luckyyang done with a feature, I said it's good as a ref to the future,
but should not be merged into master right now. You can find this in the
future on network graph.
