`index` is a list of whatever will be in next commit
it points to stuff in .git/objects, which is added by `git add`
so it also brings concept of `tracked`

first  `git add a_file`, then `a_dir`, then `.`, then challenge people what is the smallest unit of `git add`
show them `git add -i` and talk in detail of what a "change" is? and how conflicts happen.

show `git add -A`, but recomend `git commit -a`

# untracked files

`git add -i ` can handle untracked files very well
`git add -p`

# `git add .` rocks

  show people how troublesome it can be to use `git mv` `git rm` `git add xxx`
  then comes `git add .`
