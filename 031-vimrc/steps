1. intro
   1. all the colon commands, can be used in .vimrc, as well as vimscripts
   1. show people three ways to `:set nu`
   1. never touch the production area
    
       :scriptnames  

   1. show people :h vimrc, to tell people where .vimrc should be on linux
   1. if you don't have it, just create it.
      actually it is just a file, it's name and location is special, because vim will look into it and auto load it
      but if you have any other named file and :source thefile, it is the same thing
      or you can excute all lines in the file in `command line mode`, again, same deal.

1. settings

   1. tell people where can they find all the alaviable options, and what are their current options

          :h option-list "<c-]> to see details"
          :options "to see the current setting"
          :set nu? "to know one specifically"

      everything come after a `:set` is a option: boolean, number, string

1. mappings
   
       :h map.txt
       :maps "to see all maps"
       :map ,w "to see one"

   1. tell people there is `imap`, `map` is is `nmap`
