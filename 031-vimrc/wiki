1. "ALl the colon commands can be used in .vimrc, as well as vimscript"

1. if there is no `.vimrc`, vim is in `compitiable` mode, so the differences ?

   1. commandline mode, tab completion fails


1. load sequence

	locate vimrc

   and I see lots of vimrc

1. derek vimrc video

   1. vimrc is the heart of vim conf

   1. :h vimrc
      show people where .vimrc should be on Unix, if you don't have it, just create it!
      actually it is just a file, it's name and location is special, because vim will look into it and auto load it
      but if you have any other named file and :source thefile, it is the same thing
      or you can excute all lines in the file in `command line mode`, again, same deal.

          1. show people three ways to `:set nu`


1. so my talk show have clear sturcture, it show have "parts", even though I still hope audience fells everything falls into a single logical flow

   1. the main intro to vimrc
   1. settings
   1. mappings :h map.txt
   1. functions
   1. ...


   there is simply no time to go into details about "mappings", "settings"... but make sure people understand what they are, and then point them to where they can learn more.

   1. tell people there is `imap`, `map` is is `nmap`
   1. tell people where can they find all the alaviable options, and what are their current options
      
          :h option-list "<c-]> to see details"
          :options "to see the current setting"

      everything come after a `:set` is a option: boolean, number, string


1. point people to where they can learn `vim scripts`, `:h usr_41`

1. how to check if a option is set?

    :set compatible?

1. :h usr_05 : set your settings

   1. neet to show people they can add scripts in .vimrc
      
       if
         ...
       else
         ...
       endif

   1. first `setting options`, then `mappings`, `autocommand` is too difficult


1. check the output of `:scriptnames`, can I see no `/etc/vim/vimrc`, what's happening?

       peter:~/episodes/031-vimrc$ file /usr/share/vim/vimrc
       /usr/share/vim/vimrc: symbolic link to `/etc/vim/vimrc'
