if there is no `.vimrc`, vim is in `compitiable` mode, so the differences ?

1. commandline mode, tab completion fails


1. load sequence

	locate vimrc

   and I see lots of vimrc

1. derek vimrc video: http://www.derekwyatt.org/vim/vim-tutorial-videos/vim-intermediate-tutorial-videos/

   1. vimrc is the heart of vim conf

   1. :h vimrc
      show people where .vimrc should be on Unix, if you don't have it, just create it!
      actually it is just a file, it's name and location is special, because vim will look into it and auto load it
      but if you have any other named file and :source thefile, it is the same thing
      or you can excute all lines in the file in `command line mode`, again, same deal.
   1. comment it!

   1. so expalain mappings to me, dear peter
   1. talke about `leader`

   1. you need to understand `runtimepath`
      
       :h rtp

      so according to the output of the above, your one `.vim/` load first, thus if there is something same in /usr/share/vimrc ( production area ), then it will overwrite user's customization, luckliy most plugins will set a flag and saying if I've loaded, do n't load me again. then the `after`s, and your own `after` is after the production `after`
      show people my own `.vim/after/stynax` as a example


   1. never touch the "production area"

   1. check :h rtp, and you can see a list of dirs that you can put into anyone of your `rtp` dir
      like `doc`, `plugins`...

   1. write a plugin drop it into plugins/, and it just works
