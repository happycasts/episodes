if there is no `.vimrc`, vim is in `compitiable` mode, so the differences ?

1. commandline mode, tab completion fails


1. load sequence

	locate vimrc

   and I see lots of vimrc

1. derek vimrc video

   1. vimrc is the heart of vim conf

   1. :h vimrc
      show people where .vimrc should be on Unix, if you don't have it, just create it!
      actually it is just a file, it's name and location is special, because vim will look into it and auto load it
      but if you have any other named file and :source thefile, it is the same thing
      or you can excute all lines in the file in `command line mode`, again, same deal.
