1. having skull and meat
   make the essential things covered, but also try to make it beautiful and interesting

1. Web = Js + css + html
   To learn JS, you first need to know about the other too
   But to know the other two you don't have to learn JS first, so do Html+css first

1. timer
   http://project.mahemoff.com/timer/timer.html
1. code sth samll, show sth cool

1. show people document.getElementById("someid"), then what if sth without a id
   so people need to know a bit abot DOM
    
     var myElement = document.getElementById('ch_87512');
     myElement.style.display = 'none';

   Do not talk about DOM, call it a tree, everybody will understand

    theElement.parentElement

1. why u can do with JS?
   1. manipulating the TREE(DOM)?
      1. hide a element

   1. server side JS: node
   1. getGeometry API

   1. listen to events
      1. you don't need to write events they are already there, you write "event handler"

         img.onclick = function() { this.style.display = "none" ;}

1. why Jquery?
   1. do same thing with both JS and Juery, show people why jquey rocks?

      Addevent 

1. chrome devtools is not only the great way to learn CSS, but also greate to lean JS

   document.getElementsByTagName('a'); # devtools offer auto-completion
1. where is the best doc? mozilla? why?

1. once you know the basics, anything specific first google it, then type into the chromedev tools and try it out
   starting from the reference manual usually does not work for beginners
   Give a example.
