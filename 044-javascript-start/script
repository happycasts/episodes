1 Web = Js + css + html
   To learn JS, you first need to know about the other too
   But to know the other two you don't have to learn JS first, so do Html+css first
   So if you don't know CSS, never try to start JS

1. It's not how it looks, it is how it works

1. JS is now almost everywhere
   1. server side JS: node
   1. we will focus on browser for this video
   1. As to the use with web, JS is: behavior, "give sophisticated functionality to web pages" as wikipedia put it
      1. no language is competing with js as web client side language

1. http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/javascript.html#modals
   give people a basic idea, what JS can do


1. why u can do with JS?
   1. manipulating the TREE(DOM)?
      1. show people document.getElementById("someid"), then what if sth without a id
         so people need to know a bit abot DOM
          
           var myElement = document.getElementById('ch_87512');
           myElement.style.display = 'none';
           // getElementsByClassName is new, brought with html5
           // if you are using IE8-, use jQuery for this

         Do not talk about DOM, call it a tree, everybody will understand

          theElement.parentElement

   1. listen to events
      1. you don't need to write events they are already there, you write "event handler"

         img.onclick = function() { this.style.display = "none" ;}

   1. Timer

        function hello() { alert('nice'); }
        undefined
        hello
        function hello() { alert('nice'); }
        hello()
        undefined
        setTimeout(hello, 2000)

1. first get code work in devtools, then paste it into a js file, and link to it
   1. window.onload
      1. otherwise put your code at the bottom

1. chrome devtools is not only the great way to learn CSS, but also greate to lean JS

       document.getElementsByTagName('a'); # devtools offer auto-completion

1. library (specific purpose lib)
   http://lokeshdhakar.com/projects/lightbox2/
   twitter-bootstrap js components

1. why Jquery? (general purpose lib)
   1. once you know the basics, anything specific first google it, then type into the chromedev tools and try it out
      Think about something you want to do, and do it.
      starting from the reference manual usually does not work for beginners
      Start with Juery is smart. Give a example.

   https://developers.google.com/speed/libraries/?hl=zh-CN
   1. auto detect dirfferent browsers
      so that you don't need a lot if-else in your code
   1. Jquey have a much more newbie-friendly syntax

        document.getElementById("myDiv").className = "highlight";
        jQuery('#myDiv').addClass('highlight');

     1. hide a element

        JS: style.display = 'none'
        JQ: $('img').hide(4000); //very cool

        $('document').ready() mucher nicer than window.load() cause it can be called multiple times

      It's not just jquey will do the same thing, it will do things in a bit better way

1. debugging
   1. Let chromedevtool tell you the error
   1. check ep: chrome-devtools

1. where can I learn more?
   1. http://www.codecademy.com/#!/exercises/0
   1. where is the best doc? mozilla? why?
      1. https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/JavaScript/Reference
   1. http://jqueryair.com/

   1. search javascript in youku
      http://www.miaov.com/index.html.php
      you get some training schools
      1. they are great, but two problems:
         1. they don't use Unix
         1. they don't read doc in English, which means they teach oboselete stuff
