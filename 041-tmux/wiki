Everybody say clearly that they love tmux over screen
 - Screen only has Emacs key bindings
 - Screen only allow less than 50 sessions
 - Screen eats lots of memory
 - Screen only support horizontal split

1. Can I copy from linode:a_file to local_workstation:a_file with tmux?
   It will be cool if I can use Vim yank for this.
   1. you can do this, but not Vim shortcut, it's Tmux vi mode shortcut

1. Now I see Tmux is not just for pure-text consoles, like people saying
   1. cause gnome-terminal tabs are slow
   1. you can ngvigate even better with tmux copy mode

1. can I give up my `:sh` in vim now?
   1. I think so, you can always use another pane or window for your job

1. I will make tmux has the same set of vi shortcuts
   1. vi mode
1. session > windows -> pane
1. shortcuts: http://www.dayid.org/os/notes/tm.html

  C-a ?
  C-a n
  C-a , #rename the window
  C-a c # create a new window === `tmux new-window -n window_name`
  C-a % # vetical split
  C-a " # horizential split
  C-a arrow keys #switching window
  C-a t # showtime super cool
  C-a q #show pane number

  tmux new-session -s my_session_name # start a session with a name `C-a $` to rename
  tmux list-sessions  
  tmux a -t name_of_one_session

  tmux kill-sever #kill all sessions
  tmux kill-session -t xxx # kill one session

1. I want tab-complete tmux sub-commands
   1. FIXME, later
1. copy and paste, big time!
   1. C-a-[  go into copy mode, now space to start selecting, Enter to end it, finally C-a-] to paste
      1. if you have more than one pane on a window, screen tainted after yanking, why??
         1. FIXME, don't know, just don't use more than one pane to show copy&paste
      1. have one session named "rails", in which you have two windows: "happycasts" and "onestep"
         1. now copy code from one project to paste in another is very simple
         1. than add another windows, just leave the name as "bash", so I can run `tail -f xxx.log`, or git ...or rake
   1. gg and G works in copy mode
   1. MUST HAVE: I have to be able to copy from one window and paste into another, otherwise I can not use tmux
      1. sure you can
   1. navigate in copy mode is cool
       1. being about to use gg/G is not so cool, but in copy mode use can use "/" to search is super cool
          1. say you mointor log with 'tail -f xxx.log', you can now grep right with the stdout, cool aha?

1. Use case
   1. when you login to linode, you do `rake assets:precompile` there, then there is nothing you can do except watching it to finish first
   1. but if you do this in a tmux session, you can 'C-a d' to detach, do whatever you want and then go back and continue with `tmux a`
   1. you can even logout linode and do sth, then login again, and type 'tmux a' you still get what you left off, supercool, cause this means you 
      do not need to worry about, when you are doing sth there, and suddenly you lost your connection.

1. .tmux.conf

    bind a send-prefix
    #cycle between last window
    unbind ^A
    bind ^A last-window
    #split window like vim
    # vim's defination of a horizontal/vertical split is revised from tumx's
    bind s split-window -h
    bind v split-window -v
    # move arount panes wiht hjkl, as one would in vim after C-w
    bind h select-pane -L
    bind j select-pane -D
    bind k select-pane -U
    bind l select-pane -R
    # resize panes like vim
    # feel free to change the "1" to however many lines you want to resize by,
    # only one at a time can be slow
    bind < resize-pane -L 10
    bind > resize-pane -R 10
    bind - resize-pane -D 10
    bind + resize-pane -U 10

    # bind : to command-prompt like vim
    # this is the default in tmux already
    bind : command-prompt

    #vi style controls for copy mode
    setw -g mode-keys vi

1. why not use C-z+bg or 'firefox &''?
   A: you still say stdout, it's annoying. so just never mind, ignore this!
      And for sure we can handle this, but almost all the time, we actucally want to see the stdout result.

1. there is a lot more that tmux can do: check tmux.sf.net, and see the tools
