Can I copy from linode:a_file to local_workstation:a_file with tmux?
It will be cool if I can use Vim yank for this.

Can I open a terminal, but what I see is sb else doing stuff on linode?
They call it Pair programming, yea?

Now I see Tmux is not just for pure-text consoles, like people saying

    What's great about tools like GNU screen is that they allow you to quickly
    move between your terminal windows using keyboard shortcuts, which can often
    times be a lot quicker than alt+tab'ing to a new terminal window on your
    OS.  When I first made the jump from using my OS terminal program to using
    GNU screen a few years ago, my productivity shot up enormously, as I was
    able to quickly move around through terminals like I never could before.

    Pane and window management, copy-mode for navigating output,

I may hate iTerm, but I should say being able to split the terminal is cool, and sometimes very useful
A: can I give up my `:sh` in vim now?

1. session > window -> pane
1. shortcuts: http://www.dayid.org/os/notes/tm.html

  C-a ?
  C-a n
  C-a , #rename the window
  C-a c # create a new window
  C-a % # vetical split
  C-a " # horizential split
  C-a arrow keys #switching window
  C-a t # showtime super cool
  C-a q #show pane number
  

1. Use case
   1. when you login to linode, you do `rake assets:precompile` there, then there is nothing you can do except watching it to finish first
   1. but if you do this in a tmux session, you can 'C-a d' to detach, do whatever you want and then go back and continue with `tmux a`
   1. you can even logout linode and do sth, then login again, and type 'tmux a' you still get what you left off, supercool, cause this means you 
      do not need to worry about, when you are doing sth there, and suddenly you lost your connection.
