1. rails g controller demo hello

1. files
   1. tell people where they are located
   1. tell people what all the extentions mean

       erb
       htm.erb
       js.erb
       onestep/application.css.scss.erb
   1. tell people about the <% %> and <%= %>
   1. tell why layout?
      yield
      content_for

1. first show people what is render and a view template
   then:

   layout->partial->helper

    1. helpers
       javascript_include_tag
       markdown(text)

1. form_helper: http://guides.rubyonrails.org/form_helpers.html

   form_tag, form_for @posts, empty or not
   params[]

   you can pass params in URL(:id/ in route, or ?id=2&page=1), or in Form, give people a clear example, show all the values in view/log.
   people will know
   NOTE: you can use <%= params[:id] %>, you don't need to pass it from the controller, but not recommended

   You use @variables to go from CONTROLLER to VIEW, and you use PARAMS to go from Client->Controller, show people the graph


   1. still it's the resources thing make it complex, so first use a verbose action="/posts/get_mydata"
 
   1. show the whole params hash within a error shown in View
      or use <%= params.inspect %>

1. render 'hello'
 
   def index
     render 'hello'
   end

   def hello
     render (:text => "hello everyone")
   end

1. redirect_to

   def show
      if params[:tag]
        redirect_to
      else
        render 
      end
   end
   --------
   def hello
     redirect_to other_hello
   end

   def other_hello
     render (:text => "hello everyone")
   end
   -------
   if you use render, the URL won't change in your addressbar, but redirect_to will...
