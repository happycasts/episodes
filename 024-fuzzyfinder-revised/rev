As told by happyhackingï¼ŒCtrlP has all I missed here with fuzzyfinder

- create dir/file
  I can use lcd---sh---Ctrl-D---`cd -`
  big problem is I contently need to cd ../..
  So Ctrlp's project home finder is nice
- reload filelist
  for fuf, I have FufRenewcache

      CtrlP gets wired when porject is not SCM repo. aka, .git .hg is not
found


1. I can find project root with

    let origcurdir = getcwd()
    let curdir = origcurdir
    let prevdir = ""
    while curdir != prevdir
      if filereadable(".fuzzyfinder")
        break
      endif
      cd ..
      let prevdir = curdir
      let curdir = getcwd()
    endwhile
