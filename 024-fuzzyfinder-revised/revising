1. `cd :%h` or `lcd :%h` then `:sh` to create  subdir and files turned out to be really stupid
   1. cause fuzzyfinder won't load your newly created file
   1. and if you `:cd somewhere`, you always have to `:cd ~/apps/happycasts` to continue the work, so shitty
      1. so __Ctrp-P__ got this right that always keeps you at the top level of your project tree, but if you use fuzzyfinder wisely, you can be 
         cooler:
         1. just always stay at the top level of the tree, use `!mkdir -p app/views/posts` to create subdirs,
            use `:e app/views/posts/index.html.erb`
            (not `!touch`, casue then fuzzy finder won't load new file into search scope)

         1. really cool stuff, if you are now in happyec/, you can `:cd ../happycasts`, open index.html.erb with fuzzyfinder
            then go back to happyec/, and open another index.html here and do 'y' and 'p', super awesome

1. in ep24, I still say errors when fuf find too many file in scope, fix this by

       let g:fuf_enumeratingLimit = 500
