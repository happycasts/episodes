1. show people the problem: hard to open any file in a big project treee
   firstly open user_controler.rb, than route.rb (show people at the video as well, use ctrl-k)

1. why fuzzyfinder? 

   Cmd-T:

   1. limited-feature

   1. so I do not use it

   Ctrlp:

   1. Built-in root directory finder. --nice
   1. Create new files and directories.  --nice
   1. more newbie-friendly than fuzzyfinder

   fuzzyfinder:

   1. powerful and cool

1. installation, as quickly AP, do copy&paste not typing!!! 

   1. fuzzy match VS partial match
      1. `:h fuf-search-patterns`

   1. Ctrl-w to delete your string
   1. double `ESC` to quit
   1. show people the four open method:

        <CR>  (|g:fuf_keyOpen|)        - opens in a previous window.
        <C-j> (|g:fuf_keyOpenSplit|)   - opens in a split window.
        <C-k> (|g:fuf_keyOpenVsplit|)  - opens in a vertical-split window.
        <C-l> (|g:fuf_keyOpenTabpage|) - opens in a new tab page.


1. it is a vritue to only match filenames not paths, use `app/` if you want o see dir match

1. `h g:fuf_coveragefile_globPatterns` `:h g:fuf_coveragefile_exclude`

1. get rid of error color

1. Tips:

   show people how to get `route.rb` while they are in `app/views/`, `:cd ~/happyec`
