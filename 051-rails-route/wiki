no need to mention advanced features, cause it takes a lot more understanding how MVC works as a whole
1. http://guides.rubyonrails.org/routing.html
1. rake routes
1. params[:id], tell people where is this from?
1. http verbs

   show people

       posts GET    /posts(.:format)          {:action=>"index", :controller=>"posts"}
          POST   /posts(.:format)          {:action=>"create", :controller=>"posts"}
 new_post GET    /posts/new(.:format)      {:action=>"new", :controller=>"posts"}
edit_post GET    /posts/:id/edit(.:format) {:action=>"edit", :controller=>"posts"}
     post GET    /posts/:id(.:format)      {:action=>"show", :controller=>"posts"}
          PUT    /posts/:id(.:format)      {:action=>"update", :controller=>"posts"}
          DELETE /posts/:id(.:format)      {:action=>"destroy", :controller=>"posts"}

   .format

   why_put_and_delete: http://www.artima.com/lejava/articles/why_put_and_delete.html
   HTML specification only allows GET and POST as form actions: http://cafe.elharo.com/web/why-rest-failed/
1. pretty URLs matter, like twitter.com/happypeter

1. `get "demo/index" will work
    
      get "demo/index" 
      match "demo/index", :to => "demo#index"

1. put a "demo/index.html" in "public/"
1. show people the graph.


1. check default route.rb file, good info there:

  # The priority is based upon order of creation:
  # first created -> highest priority.

1. three basic types
   1. simple route

        get "demo/index" 

   1. default route

      # This is a legacy wild controller route that's not recommended for RESTful applications. 
      # Note: This route will make all actions in every controller accessible via GET requests. 
      # match ':controller(/:action(/:id(.:format)))' 

   1. root route
  
      root :to
